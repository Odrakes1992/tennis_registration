### Brief

You are the accountant of a tennis club. You are also a renowned Front End developer they know they cannot do anything without you. The first task in your list is to prepare a registration form for new users, which takes them to a welcome page with a list of all players in the club.

You also want to make the website pleasant to use, to make it attractive to potential new club members, so you know all the tricks to make the user experience as neat as possible, with good use of colours and fonts.

### Things to consider

- The register page will be used on desktop and mobile devices
- It should ask at least for name, surname, email address and – of course – a password
- It may be useful for the user to know when they have made an error when using the form, and where
- When the user clicks ‘Register’, display the submitted data in the console as a JSON object
- A successful registration should take the user to a welcome page with the list of players in descending order by points, but it would be nice if they could be sorted by other parameters
- You may want to collect a user’s nationality, favourite Pokémon or favourite Star Wars character. Consider connecting to an API and displaying data in a dropdown for the user to select
  - Countries – https://restcountries.com/
  - Pokémon – https://pokeapi.co/
  - Star Wars - https://swapi.dev/

### Todo

- Test for submission of data displaying to the console.
- When sorting table userdata disappears
